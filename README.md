make a web game to practice how to uses of JQuery

How to play:
You can press any key to start and it will show you a tile that you have to click on. As you go from level lto level, 
the patterns get more and more complicated, and at some point you're going to screw up and it's going to tell you that you've got it wrong
and game is over.
